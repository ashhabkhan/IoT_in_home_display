# Weekly progress and issues faced
## Week 1
### Tasks
- Design finalisation 
- Workshops completed
### Problems
- N/A 
## Week 2
### Tasks 
- Components ordered
### Problems
- Time was consumed in procurement of hardware components(i.e ADS1115, ZMPT101B and ACS7120) which were received in the next week.
## Week 3
### Tasks 
- ADS1115 communication with ESP8266
- ZMPT101B communication with ESP8266
### Problems
- Unable to read voltage from ADS1115 as soldering was required along with a multimeter to test actual values of voltage. 
- Readings couldnt be verified at home as multimeter was required
## Week 4 
### Tasks 
- DC and AC power supplies were required for operating current and voltage sensor 
### Problems
- We tried calibrating the sensor with direct 220V AC at home but a multimeter was required in order to verify the readings. 
## Week 5 
### Tasks 
- Read both voltage and current sensor through ADc in ESP8266
- LCD display/operate with ESP8266
- Verified working of current sensor, ADS1115 and voltage sensor in TGGS lab as DC and AC power supplies were required from the lab  
- Load prediction and energy consumption algorithm (in progress)
